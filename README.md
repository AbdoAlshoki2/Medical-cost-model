# Medical Cost Prediction Notebook

This repository contains a Python notebook for an end-to-end medical cost prediction project. The notebook includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: The data is loaded and cleaned by removing null values, converting strings, and dropping unnecessary features.

2. **Data Analysis**: The correlation between the target variable (medical cost) and the features is analyzed and visualized.

3. **Model Training**: Different models including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are trained on the preprocessed data.

4. **Error Calculation and Model Comparison**: The errors of the different models are calculated and compared to choose the best performing model.
